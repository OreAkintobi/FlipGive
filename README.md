# Frontend Solution

## My Notes

1. This is my code for FlipGive's frontend mobile engineering challenge.
2. This codebase contains organised code written in Typescript. Some of the reused code is seperated into components.
3. Code is organised and performant.
4. Given more time, I would do the following:
   - write some tests (tests to ensure that each part of the app renders properly, as well as tests for the API and the util functions.
   - add dynamic search results rendering so the search runs after 2 or 3 seconds of the user not typing any added text.
   - use [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) to properly create a theming structure and more robust way to expose my screens and components to colors, fonts, et cetera
5. Handle Pagination
6. **Screenshots** of the project on iOS and Android devices are below.

## How to run the project

1. clone the repo and run `yarn install`.
2. run `yarn start` to open the project server in a browser window.
3. use your phone camera/QR code scanner app to open the application in your device, or click to run in simulator, web or emulator (Needs Expo Go).
